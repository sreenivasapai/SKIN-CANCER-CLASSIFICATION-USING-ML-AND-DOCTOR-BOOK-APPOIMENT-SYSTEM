# SKIN-CANCER-CLASSIFICATION-USING-ML-AND-DOCTOR-BOOK-APPOIMENT-SYSTEM
This smart healthcare platform uses AI (EfficientNetB3) to detect skin cancer from validated lesion images, provides risk analysis with visual explanations, and enables seamless doctor appointment booking. Patients get AI reports, doctors manage cases via dashboards, bridging diagnosis with fast medical care.

This web-enabled smart healthcare solution offers an integrated platform that combines **AI-powered skin cancer detection** with a **streamlined doctor appointment booking system**, aiming to improve early diagnosis and accelerate access to dermatological care.

The system allows users to upload a **photo of a skin lesion**, which first undergoes an **image validation process** to ensure it depicts a genuine skin-related issue. Once validated, the image is analyzed using a **deep learning model based on EfficientNetB3**, trained on extensive dermatology datasets. The model classifies the lesion as *cancerous* or *non-cancerous*, providing a **confidence score** for transparency and informed decision-making.

For images predicted to be cancerous, the platform activates an **AI-driven risk analysis module**. This feature determines the **severity level** of the lesion, generates explanations for the assessment, and visualizes risk factors using **interactive charts** to help patients understand the condition. Patients are then encouraged to **book an appointment with a certified dermatologist** based on the AI’s findings.

The integrated 
**appointment booking system** lets users select a doctor, browse available time slots, and schedule consultations directly from the platform. On the other end, doctors have access to a 
**personalized dashboard** where they can view new cases, analyze
**AI-generated reports**, upload additional diagnostic images, and manage patient case statuses by flagging them as “Cancerous” or “Normal.”

The platform also features 

**automated PDF report generation**, providing patients with downloadable, personalized reports containing diagnostic results and recommendations. An intelligent 

**chatbot (SkinMate)** is available to answer basic skin cancer–related queries, improving accessibility and patient engagement.

Key features include skin lesion validation, deep learning–based diagnosis, AI-powered risk analysis, visual risk factor explanation, role-based dashboards, doctor case management, PDF reporting, and an integrated chatbot.

Impact:
This solution bridges the gap between early AI-based skin cancer detection and timely medical consultation. By combining cutting-edge machine learning with seamless healthcare access, it not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also accelerates patient response times. This can lead to significantly improved treatment outcomes through earlier intervention, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized dermatological care.
